### ISSUE-1 [CLOSED a45088b] setup/bootstrap.ps1 failed to parse on Windows PowerShell 5.1
BLOCKS: none   SEVERITY: low   OPENED: 2026-10-11 session 1
The kit script was UTF-8 without a BOM; PowerShell 5.1 read it as ANSI, turned the em-dashes into quote
characters and aborted before doing anything ("The term 'tick' is not recognized"). Fixed by adding a UTF-8 BOM
to the file (no other change). It then ran clean: .venv, packages, git init, identity. Teammates get the fix.

### ISSUE-2 [CLOSED 5cff14d] HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED — GPU JOB READY: M00 runner probe (job 20261011-014756_M00)
BLOCKS: M00   SEVERITY: high   OPENED: 2026-10-11 session 1
Why: the laptop has no GPU; M00 S6 needs one real run on a free Colab GPU to identify the runner (about 2 minutes).
File to upload: D:\PJT\vcloak\gpujobs\out\20261011-014756_M00\job.zip
Notebook:       D:\PJT\vcloak\colab\VCloak_GPU_Runner.ipynb
Do this (Google Colab; needs a Google account):
  1. Open https://colab.research.google.com -> File -> Upload notebook -> pick colab\VCloak_GPU_Runner.ipynb.
  2. Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator: T4 GPU -> Save.   (the step everyone forgets)
  3. Run Cell 1. It must print a GPU name (e.g. Tesla T4). If it prints NO GPU, redo step 2.
  4. Run Cell 2. When the file picker appears, choose gpujobs\out\20261011-014756_M00\job.zip.
  5. Run Cell 3 and keep the tab open (about 2 minutes).
  6. Run Cell 4. results_20261011-014756_M00.zip downloads.
  7. Move that file into D:\PJT\vcloak\gpujobs\inbox\   (do not unzip or rename it).
If Colab refuses a GPU, use Kaggle: kaggle.com -> Create -> New Notebook -> File -> Import Notebook -> the same
  .ipynb; Settings -> Accelerator -> GPU T4 x2; + Add Input -> Upload -> job.zip as a dataset; in Cell 2 set
  KAGGLE_INPUT = "/kaggle/input/<your-dataset>/job.zip"; run all; download the results zip from the Output panel.
Bring back only the results zip. Do not commit or edit anything in the repo before the next session:
  a change to src/, kernels/, tests/, bench/ or scripts/ makes the result stale and it will be rejected.
Confirm by running: .venv\Scripts\python scripts\gpujob.py verify gpujobs\inbox\results_20261011-014756_M00.zip
Then type: continue
Resolved session 2: results zip delivered (Kaggle T4), verified and ingested; bundle in gpujobs/done/.

### ISSUE-3 [OPEN] Runner package set differs from requirements-gpu.txt
BLOCKS: none   SEVERITY: low   OPENED: 2026-10-11 session 2
requirements-gpu.txt names cupy-cuda12x, but the Kaggle T4 runner already ships CuPy 14.0.1 on CUDA runtime 13.0
(driver 580.82.07, Python 3.13.15), so gpu_entry skipped both installs. The probe compiled and ran correctly on it.
Risk: a Colab session may ship a different CuPy/CUDA pair, and the file no longer describes what actually ran.
Proposed fix (M03 prep): make the requirement runtime-agnostic or record the installed wheel name in result.json;
keep comparing `cupy`/`cuda` in each manifest before mixing timings from different sessions.

### ISSUE-4 [CLOSED] M02 secrets scanner must allow-list the golden vectors
BLOCKS: none   SEVERITY: low   OPENED: 2026-10-11 session 3
tests/golden/oracle_perm_n*.json hold base64 permutations and sha256 hex digests. They contain no key material
(tests/unit/test_oracle_golden.py asserts this), but `scripts/check_secrets.py` (M02 S6) is specified to flag any
32-byte hex/base64 run in tracked files, so it will flag every one of them.
Proposed fix (M02 S6): allow-list tests/golden/*.json by file hash, next to the RFC vectors. Also in M02 S7: set
IMPLEMENTED = True in vcloak.crypto.{chacha_ref,aead_ref} and run `python scripts/make_golden.py --check`; the
golden files must come out identical, since the byte formats do not change.
Resolved session 4: scripts/secrets_allowlist.json lists the golden files by file hash; IMPLEMENTED is True in both references and `make_golden.py --check` reports the three files identical.

### ISSUE-5 [CLOSED d91bfd6] Each GPU job's bundle_sha256 must be allow-listed for G4
BLOCKS: none   SEVERITY: low   OPENED: 2026-10-11 session 4
`scripts/gpujob.py` writes a 64-hex `bundle_sha256` into job.json, result.json, pack logs and run manifests. It is
a content hash, not the SHA-256 of job.zip, so `scripts/check_secrets.py` cannot verify it and reports it as a
key-like run. The M00 job's digest was allow-listed by hand in session 4. Every later pack (M03 onwards) will make
G4 fail until its digest is allow-listed.
Workaround (any session that packs a job): run `python scripts/check_secrets.py`, copy the `id=` of the finding, then
`python scripts/check_secrets.py --allow <id> --reason "bundle_sha256 of GPU job <job id>"`.
Proposed fix (M03 prep session, owner of scripts/gpujob.py): have `gpujob.py pack` add that allow-list entry itself.
Resolved session 5: `gpujob.py pack` adds the digest to scripts/secrets_allowlist.json itself; that file is no longer bundled or part of the staleness check, so the write cannot invalidate the job (tests/unit/test_gpujob.py).

### ISSUE-6 [CLOSED PENDING_HASH] HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED — GPU JOB READY: M03 bitonic kernels (job 20261011-173759_M03)
BLOCKS: M03   SEVERITY: high   OPENED: 2026-10-11 session 5
Why: the laptop has no GPU and no nvcc. The bitonic kernels have only run as NumPy twins and through a g++ CPU
stand-in; M03 needs one real run to compile them with CUDA, compare them byte for byte with the oracle and the
simulator up to n = 2^24, run the race check and take the timing smoke (about 20 minutes on the runner).
File to upload: D:\PJT\vcloak\gpujobs\out\20261011-173759_M03\job.zip
Notebook:       D:\PJT\vcloak\colab\VCloak_GPU_Runner.ipynb
Do this (Google Colab; needs a Google account, nothing to install):
  1. Open https://colab.research.google.com -> File -> Upload notebook -> pick colab\VCloak_GPU_Runner.ipynb.
  2. Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator: T4 GPU -> Save.   (the step everyone forgets)
  3. Run Cell 1. It must print a GPU name (e.g. Tesla T4). If it prints NO GPU, redo step 2.
  4. Run Cell 2. When the file picker appears, choose gpujobs\out\20261011-173759_M03\job.zip.
  5. Run Cell 3 and keep the tab open (about 20 minutes; the last command sorts 16 million records on the CPU too).
  6. Run Cell 4. results_20261011-173759_M03.zip downloads.
  7. Move that file into D:\PJT\vcloak\gpujobs\inbox\   (do not unzip or rename it).
Or use Kaggle, as for the M00 probe: kaggle.com -> Create -> New Notebook -> File -> Import Notebook -> the same
  .ipynb; Settings -> Accelerator -> GPU T4 x2; + Add Input -> Upload -> job.zip as a dataset; in Cell 2 set
  KAGGLE_INPUT = "/kaggle/input/<your-dataset>/job.zip"; run all; download the results zip from the Output panel.
Bring back only the results zip, even if a cell reports a failure: a failed run is still evidence and is fixed in
  the next session. Do not commit or edit anything in the repo before the next session: a change to src/,
  kernels/, tests/, bench/ or scripts/ makes the result stale and it will be rejected.
Confirm by running: .venv\Scripts\python scripts\gpujob.py verify gpujobs\inbox\results_20261011-173759_M03.zip
Then open a new session and type: continue
Resolved session 6: the human ran the job on Kaggle (Tesla T4, session 20261011-122243) and dropped the results zip
in gpujobs/inbox/; `gpujob.py ingest` verified it and all 5 commands exited 0 (runs/20261011-122303_M03_bitonic_smoke).

### ISSUE-7 [OPEN] Telemetry during a timed section: 1 sample, taken at idle
BLOCKS: none   SEVERITY: medium   OPENED: 2026-10-11 session 6
Symptom: in runs/20261011-122303_M03_bitonic_smoke the manifest's start snapshot shows the SM clock at 900 MHz
(idle, util 6%) and the end snapshot 1590 MHz; telemetry.csv holds 1 sample, also from before the ramp. The gate
"SM clock dropped more than 15% during the run" therefore compares against an idle baseline and cannot detect a
throttle that happens inside the timed runs; only the CV speaks for stability. Harmless for the M03 smoke value,
not acceptable for M07 sweeps (ai/GPU_RUNNER.md §7).
Cause: `telemetry.Sampler` polls slower than the timed section lasts (30 sorts at 2^16 take about 20 ms), and the
start snapshot is taken before the warm-up.
Proposed fix (M07 prep, or the first module that reports timings): take a snapshot after the warm-up and one
after the last timed run, write both to summary.json, and apply the 15% gate to that pair in either direction.
